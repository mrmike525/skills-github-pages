        Hello, my name is <b id="fName">Michael Lange.</b>
        <br> <br>
        I am learning front end software development or A.K.A. web development. I am currently studying HTML(hyperTextMarkupLanguage), CSS(cascadingStyleSheets), and javaScript. I also expect 
        to learn a little about API's, Git and GitHub, and jsReact. After that, the world is my oyster, and I suppose I could take up more topics. 
            </p>
            <p>I love electronics. My previous work experience includes working for Apple Technical support as a Tier 1(advisor) and Tier 2(seniorAdvisor). In these roles I primarily helped 
                customers solve complex technical and satisfaction issues with their iPhones, iPads, and Mac's. I am also formely compTia A+ certified as a computer technician. I have also 
                worked as a senior hardware repair technician at a company called "Uptown Phone Repair". In this role, I helped customers solve complex hardware and software issues with their 
            phones, tablets and computers. I replaced screens, batteries, and antennaes on damaged or non working devices.</p>

            <p>I love to keep up with new products and services by watching product reviews on youtube. I love to maintain and build computers and have been doing so for years. It all started 
                with our first family computer when I was about twevle years old. It was a Packard Bell with a Pentium 100mhz(pentiumOne, the original), 8mb of ram, 1gb hd,  and windows 95, with 
                a 1mb video card and a terrible sound card with a 14.4k modem. Ever since than, I have loved computers and all kinds of electronics. Alot of my early experiences with computers 
                started with solving hardware and software problems on this computer and boy did I have fun solving them. :-)
